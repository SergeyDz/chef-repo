# maven Cookbook CHANGELOG
This file is used to list changes made in each version of the maven cookbook.

## v2.1.1 (2016-02-16)
- Increase the ark version pin to ~1.0 to bring in the last 2 years of ark changes
- Require the latest java cookbook to fix install issues on Ubuntu/Debian and to support the latest OpenJDK releases
- Updated all testing dependencies
- Updated the platforms that are tested in Test Kitchen

## v2.1.0 (2015-11-25)
- Added a new settings LWRP for updating maven settings. See the readme for details
- Add the group lwrp property to the readme

## v2.0.1 (2015-11-16)
- Added Chefspec matchers
- Updated the LWRP with a new attribute `group` that defaults to node['root_group'] which enables support for platforms such as FreeBSD and OS X where root's group is not root.

## v2.0.0 (2015-11-16)
BREAKING CHANGES:
- Support for Maven 2 has been removed. In doing so the attribute structure has been changed.  The `version` attribute now has the complete version string not just the major version.  The `url` and 'checksum' attributes are now top level attributes instead of being under the individual maven versions.  See the readme for the up to date attribute structure.
- Java is no longer installed by this cookbook.  Maven 3 requires JRE 8, which may require installing Oracle Java depending on the age of your platform. The user need to handle the installation of Java by using the java cookbook or their own wrapper cookbook.
